# SpaceHub

SpaceHub is an online marketplace that allows users to provide and search for the perfect venue spots for offsite meetings, team building events, meetups, office space, group happy hours, Jen's bachelorette party and more!
Our platform brings visibility to underutilized space in an office, restaurant or gallery and turns it into a profitable gig.
